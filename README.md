[00:08.76] There are places I'll remember
[00:13.42] All my life though some have changed
[00:18.26] Some forever, not for better
[00:22.80] Some have gone and some remain
[00:37.80] 
[00:27.39] All these places have their moments
[00:32.35] With lovers and friends I still can recall
[00:36.78] Some are dead and some are living
[00:41.69] In my life, I've loved them all
[00:57.19] 
[00:50.75] But of all these friends and lovers
[00:55.24] There is no one compares with you
[00:59.94] And these memories lose their meaning
[01:04.64] When I think of love as somethin' new
[01:23.14] 
[01:09.44] Though I know I'll never lose affection
[01:14.28] For people and things that went before
[01:18.94] I know I'll often stop and think about them
[01:23.61] In my life, I love you more
[01:37.11] 
[01:46.47] Though I know I'll never lose affection
[01:51.32] For people and things that went before
[01:56.02] I know I'll often stop and think about them
[02:00.54] In my life, I love you more
[02:14.04] 
[02:09.77] In my life, I love you more
